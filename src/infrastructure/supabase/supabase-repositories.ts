/**
 * supabase-repositories — factory that builds a complete `Repositories` object
 * backed by Supabase, while gracefully falling back to mock for repositories
 * that have not yet been ported.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURE:
 *   - Auth: SupabaseAuthRepository (wraps supabase.auth) — fully implemented
 *   - Approval workflow: SupabaseApprovalRepository (wraps Edge Function) — fully implemented
 *   - Audit: minimal Supabase adapter calling the `write_audit_log` RPC
 *   - Notifications: minimal Supabase adapter (read + mark-read)
 *   - All other repositories: FALLBACK to mock implementations with a console
 *     warning. This allows incremental migration — each repository can be
 *     ported to Supabase independently without blocking the release.
 *
 * PLAN §12.05: service_role key is NEVER used here. All client-side access uses
 * the anon key, gated by RLS.
 *
 * MIGRATION PATH:
 *   1. Start with mockRepositories (VITE_USE_SUPABASE=false)
 *   2. Set VITE_USE_SUPABASE=true to enable Supabase auth + approval workflow
 *   3. As each repository is ported, replace its mock with the Supabase impl
 *      in the `getSupabaseRepositories()` function below.
